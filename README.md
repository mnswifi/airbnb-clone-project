# airbnb-clone-project

## Project Overview

The projects seeks to provide a comprehensive, real-world application designated to simulate the development of booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a dive into the backend systems, database design, API developmemnt, security and best practices. This project aims to enable a deep understanding of complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics geared towards building a scalable web application.

## Technology Stack

Technology stack to be used in this project are as follows:

- Django: A Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database (RDBM) used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes, and also aids seamless of apps from development to production.

## Team Roles

- Business Analyst: This individual is responsible in understanding customer's business processes, translating customer business needs into requirements.
- Product owner (PO): Responsible for product vision and evolution, making sure the final product meets customer requirements.
- Project Manager (PM): Ensures product on-time delivery, and within budget. Spearheads software development team.
- UI/UX Designer (UX): Transform a product vision into user-friendly interface. Creates user journey for the best user experience.
- Software Architect (SA): Designs a high-level software architecture, selecting appropriate tools and technologies to implement the product vision.
- Software developer: Engineers and stabilizes the product, solves any technical problems emerging during the development process.
- Quality Assurance (QA) engineer: Ensures an application performs according to requirements, spots functional and non-functional defects.
- DevOps engineer: Facilitates cooperation between development and operations teams.
- Test Automation Engineer (TA): Designs a test automation ecosystem.
 
## Database Design

- Key entities (Users, Properties, Booking, Reviews, and Payments)
For each entity, list 3-5 important fields and describe how these entities are related (e.g., a user can have multiple properties, a booking belongs to a property, etc.).

- Describe how these entities are related.

## Feature Breakdown

- user management
- Property management
- booking system
1. API Documentation
OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.
